					<p>In times of uncertainty ... <br>
					When future is hazy,<br>
					Present is scary,<br>
					Past seems the only good thing that is left now<br>
					This is the past which gave us all the liberty to<br>
					Do whatever we want<br>
					Roam wherever we want<br>
					Eat whatever we want<br>
					Like whomever we want<br>
					But still we chose not to.<br>
					Because we didn't have the time to live as we want to.<br>
					Now is the time to cherish all those moments of  freedom<br>
					To be kind and caring, <br>
					towards all those things and people who were our own<br>
					Because now we have nothing but time <br>

				<div class="content_extras">
					Standing on the terrace, looking at the glowing moon <br>
					I can feel the strong breeze and see the unbounded sky <br>
					but in the back of my mind, I am in a different world <br>
					where I see myself not as <br>
					a companion or a competitor <br>
					a servant or a ruler <br>
					a struggler or an achiever <br>
					but as a better human being <br>
					who has the courage to lose the sight of the shore to explore the new oceans<br>
					who is powerful enough to make this planet a paradise where utopia is not merely a fiction but a reality<br>
					who can experience all the wonders of this universe without any magical powers<br>
					who can fly beyond the imaginations of mind where time is not a constraint to cherish the amazing moments<br>
					who never craves to be the best because that restrain my boundaries<br>

				<div class="content_extras">
					As we reached the abode of water when it was dawning,<br>
					the sky was slightly dark and filled with clouds<br>
					the moon was trying to illuminate it by its unquestionable charm.<br><br>

					As we were eagerly waiting for the sun to shine and brighten up the sky,<br>
					the red hot ball was shying away from us, hiding behind the clouds .<br><br>

					As the warm water of sea was playing with our feet, <br>
					our hopeful eyes were fixed on the horizon, praying...<br>
					Oh mighty and glorious Sun !<br>
					Please shower your radiance upon us<br>
					We are eager to embrace your soothing rays<br>
					Stop playing hide and seek<br>
					We are waiting to get your charismatic glimpse<br>
